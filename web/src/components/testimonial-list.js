const txt = `Highly recommend My Mates Van! Todd custom built a draw set and sleeping platform into the back of my Subaru Outback - car camper style. He was friendly, easy to work with and had great communication when explaining how the finished product look. I came to My Mates Van with a rough outline of what I wanted, but Todd brought some amazing ideas/fixes and created a plan that utilised the space perfectly. He clearly has a high level of carpentry skill and a creative eye for the intricacies of working in vans. He kept in touch during the build and had it completed within the timeframe. I couldnâ€™t be happier with the work and would happily head back for another project ðŸšš`
